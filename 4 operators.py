#  Arithmetic operator

a = 66
b= 43
c = a+b
d = a/b
print(c)
print(d)


# Assignment operator 

a = 5-2
b = 2*2

c= a*b
print(c)


x = 44
y = 32

# y +=22 if we  want to increment  the value  of y variable.
# y-=22 if we want to decrement  the value of y  variable.
 
z = x+y
print(z)




#  COmparison operators

A = 4>5
print(A)


B = 7<9
print(B)

P = 44-22 > 33+2
print(P)




#   Logical operators




# Practice Set for Operators

# a = 15, b = 4 → Print remainder (a % b)

a = 15
b = 4
print(a%b)

# Use a *= b → Then print new value of a

a = 5
b = 7
a*=b 
print(a+b)


# Check: a == b, a != b, and a >= b

a == b 
print(a==b)
print(a!=b)
print(a>=b)


# Use logical operators with:

x = 50

y = 30

print(x > 40) 

print(y < 20)

print(not(y == 30))
